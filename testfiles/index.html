<center>I have been living in Las Cruces for most of my life since I moved here from Albuquerque. While there aren't an abudance of attractions in Las Cruces, there are a few places I can recommend to vistors. The <em>Farmers & Crafts Market</em> on Main Street is a great place to go on the weekends if you enjoy fresh produce, artisanal crafts, and street musicians. If you enjoy the outdoors, there are several great trails and hiking spots in and around Las Cruces. Lastly, <em>Old Mesilla</em> is a beautiful part of town with several shops and award-winning restraunts that is definitely worth checking out!</center>
